## 📥 Installaton instruction
If you like my website, you are welcome to use it as a template or base of your own website! Especially if you aew new, I personally think copying is a good way to start.

The only thing I kindly ask is that you edit or claim any of my contents as yours. This means you can't use any gifs, images, my blog posts "Growth Log", anything I created. I probably wouldn't sue you but it's just not cool, yknow?
```
// at your /home
git clone git@github.com:DrCardamom/shimbaofficial-gatsby.git

// or if SSH clone doesn't work for you, try https clone (but remember, ssh clone is better)
git clone https://github.com/DrCardamom/shimbaofficial-gatsby.git

//then install all dependencies at cloned local repo. So do
cd shimbaofficial-gatsby
npm install

// to start up the server,
gatsby develop

++++++
// Additionally, once you finalize your code, you can 
gatsby build 

// then see what the build file would look like on browser
gatsby serve

```
