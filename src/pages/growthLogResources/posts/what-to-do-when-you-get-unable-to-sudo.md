As the title says - a while ago I was doing something with my operating system Pop!OS and voila, all of a sudden my laptop threw me a pop up saying something like 'low disk capacity - /boot/efi 100% full, 0MB available'. Wow, thanks, that seems quite alarming and not very fun. In fact, the Internet told me that /boot/efi has very much to do with rebooting and I did not want my computer to be a useless plastic brick, so intead of putting it off I decided to deal with it immediately, which did make me feel like I was finally a competent adult.
